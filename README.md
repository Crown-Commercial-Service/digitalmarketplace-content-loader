## Releasing a new version

To update the package version, edit the `__version__ = ...` string in `dmcontent/__init__.py`,
commit and push the change and wait for CI to create a new version tag.

Once the tag is available on GitHub, the new version can be used by the apps by adding the following
line to the app `requirements.txt` (replacing `X.Y.Z` with the current version number):

```
git+https://github.com/alphagov/digitalmarketplace-content-loader.git@X.Y.Z#egg=digitalmarketplace-content-loader==X.Y.Z
```

When changing a major version number consider adding a record to the `CHANGELOG.md` with a
description of the change and an example of the upgrade process for the client apps.
